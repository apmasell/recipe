\begin{directions}
\item Preheat oven to \tF{325}.
\item Place nuts in a baking pan and bake for 8 to 10~minutes, or until lightly brown (Pine nuts need only 6 to 8 minutes).
\item To skin hazelnuts, let the toasted nuts cool for 1 to 2~minutes, then rub the still-warm nuts between the palms of your hands, layers of a kitchen towel, or paper towels, letting the papery skins flake away.
