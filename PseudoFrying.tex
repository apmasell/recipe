\begin{recipe}{Pseudo-frying}{America's Test Kitchen}{}

This is meant as a substitute to breading and frying in oil. The heating in hot oil causes Maillard reactions to brown and flavour the coating. This method recreates that flavour without using much oil.

Use the same type of bread crumbs or coating and the same type of meat, fish, or vegetable in the original recipe. Because of the reduced quantity of oil, use the same oil in the original recipe or a better one.
