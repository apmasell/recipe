\begin{recipe}{Pennsylvania Dutch Hard Pretzels}{}{14}

\begin{ingredients}
\item \gr{88} sourdough starter
\item \gr{8} salt
\item \gr{20} malt powder or malt syrup
\item \gr{220} water
\item \gr{352} flour
\item \gr{15} lye
\item coarse salt
\end{ingredients}

\begin{directions}
\item Combine starter, salt, malt, water, and flour and knead until smooth and elastic.
\item Let rise for 8~hours.
\item Divide into \gr{50} pieces and round.
\item Let rest 15~minutes.
\item On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a rope that is \inch{\half} in the middle third and \inch{\quarter} for third nearest each end. If the rope is too thick, the pretzel will not dry during baking and will be tough.
\item Shape each rope into a pretzel shape and lay on a flour-dusted couche. The thinner ends of the rope should mean that the main backbone of the pretzel and the middle are approximately the same diameter. Make sure there is plenty of space in the holes of each pretzel. If they close up during rising, they will not dry duing baking.
\item Let rise for 6 to 8~hours, until doubled in bulk.
\item Preheat oven to \tF{550}.
\item Fill a stainless steel pot with \C{3} of water.
\item While wearing rubber gloves, add lye to water. Alwayas add lye to water; never water to lye.
\item Heat lye mixture until all lye dissolves and mixture is warm. It does not need to come to a boil.
\item Prepare a peel or inverted sheet pan by placing a sheet of parchment paper down and then liberally salting the paper with coarse salt.
\item Working in batches, place pretzels in the lye path for 10~seconds, then flip, then wait another 10~seconds, then transfer to the parchment.
\item Sprinkle coarse salt on top of the pretzels.
\item Bake for 10~minutes on a pizza stone.
\item Remove from the oven and peel pretzels off of the parchement paper.
\item Reduce temperature to oven to \tF{300}.
\item Return pretzels to oven (either directly on the stone or on a sheet pan).
\item Bake for 1 to 1\half{}~hours until pretzels are hard when pressed firmly.

\hint{This recipe is a hybrid of information from tours of Martin's and Hammond's pretzel factories.}
\hint{If making multiple batchs, keep the oven at \tF{550} and do the 10~minute bake for all batches, then reduce temperature and perform the second bake. It is not a problem if the pretzels cool between bakes.}
