\begin{recipe}{French Bread}{}{}

\begin{ingredients}
\item \C{1} sourdough starter
\item \C{\half} milk
\item \Tp{1\eighth} sugar
\item \tp{2\quarter} salt
\item \C{\eighth} shortening 
\item \C{1\twothird} flour
\end{ingredients}

\begin{directions}

\item Heat milk, sugar, salt, and shortening in a pan until shortening melts, then cool to lukewarm.

\item Stir milk into starter. Add flour gradually, forming dough that pulls away from sides of the bowl.

\item Knead until smooth, adding flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the board. When done, the dough will be fairly heavy, but smooth in texture.

\item Place in a well-greased bowl and raise in a warm place until doubled.

\item Form into a long loaf. Place on a greased baking sheet and let rise again, until almost doubled.

\item Cut diagonal slits in top of loaf with a sharp knife, and bake in a \tF{400} oven until done, about 35~minutes.
