\chapter{ Introduction }

\section { Welcome }

These are recipes I have collected from various places. Most of them are
family recipies. Some recpies are marked \UNTESTED meaning I have not
made them, but they seem sound.  I will test them eventually.\par

\section { Preparation }

This has been typeset using \LaTeX{}, using custom recipe environments.
The cover graphic was made in Kontour.\par

\section { Conversion Hints }

Baking is mostly imperial, but I am a very metric person. Since a cup is
125\,mL which is realtively ``round'' number, I can live with the
inconsitancies, but it is good to know that: \par

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
3 tsp & = & 1 tbsp & = & \half oz \\
1 cup & = & 8 oz & = & \quarter qt 
\end{tabular}

\section { Bread Cooking }
According to Alton Brown, bread should be cooked until it reaches an internal termperature of \tF{207}. Any higher than \tF{210} or lower than \tF{205} will result in bad bread. Times are suggestions based on experience before cooking by temperature or for recipes where inserting a temperature probe is not practical. Any recipes where bread is not cooked to \tF{207} are explicitly labelled.
