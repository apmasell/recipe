\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Welcome}
This book started because most of our family recipes were not written down. Those that were, often had misleading or blatantly incorrect instructions. Those that were correct, were still cryptic asking for ``enough flour to make dough the right consistency''. A particularly good example is the Breakfast Cookie recipe\seerecipe{Cookies:BreakfastCookies} which required ``2~heaping teaspoons'' of baking powder. First, these were not standard teaspoons, but kitchen serving teaspoons. The heap is supposed to be so large that it almost cannot be removed from the container. After some precise measurements with a scale, I found that these ``teaspoons'' were 3~times larger than a standard teaspoon.

I hope to slowly standardise the recipes and make the quantities sound. It is best to assume all quantities, if even present, are subject to judgement and revision. If you make a discovery about a quantity, please tell me and I will change this book.

Some recipes are marked \UNTESTED{} meaning I have not made them, but they seem sound even though they came from the Internet. Some recipes are marked with \FIXME{}. These are undoubtedly family recipes lacking quantities, having incorrect quantities, or having missing information. If you make one of these, please accurately measure the ingredients and help me update this book.


\section{Preparation}
This has been typeset using \href{http://www.ctan.org}{\LaTeX}, using custom recipe environments. The cover graphic was made in \href{http://www.inkscape.org}{Inkscape}. Revision control is done through \href{http://subversion.tigris.org/}{Subversion}.\par

\section{Conversion Hints}
It is good to know that: \par

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}
\tp{3} & = & \Tp{1} & = & \oz{\half} & = & \C{$\sfrac{1}{16}$} \\
\C{1} & = & \oz{8} & = & \qt{\quarter} & = & \mL{250}
\end{tabular}

In this book, no distinction is made between fluid ounces and avoirdupois ounces~(mass) in writing. I hope to eventually replace all ounces with either grams or mL.

Aromatics generally form the basis of a dish, especially a soup or stew. They are usually sautéed with butter, oil, the fat render from the meat in the dish, or a combination. There is some flexibility and one aromatic combination may be substituted for another to change the flavour of a dish without leaving a ``hole''.

A cured potato has a thick skin while a new potato has a thin one. Normally, ``new potatoes'' are new white potatoes.

Potatoes~(\textit{Solanum tuberosum}) and sweet potatoes~(\textit{Ipomoea batatas}) are only distantly related. Although sweet potatoes are called ``yams'', that refers to a more distantly related plant, \textit{Dioscorea}~sp. Sweet potatoes are actually most closely related to common morning glories~(\textit{Ipomoea purpurea}). They are usually acceptable substitutes for potato, except for the skin, as the ``in-between'' type.

\noindent\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
\hline
Class & Uses\\
\hline
Mealy & Baking\\
      & Mashing\\
      & French fries\\
      & Baking\\

      & Salad \\
      & Casseroles \\
      & Roasting \\
      & Barbecuing \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

In-between varieties can do the jobs of mealy or waxy potatoes, but not as well. Mealy potatoes become light and fluffy when cooked, but tend to fall apart. Waxy potatoes keep their shape, but become lumpy when mashed. Yukon Gold is particularly good for gnocchi and perogies because it can be mashed smoothly (like a mealy potato), but does not absorb much water (like a waxy potato).

\subsection{Pastry Methods}
Most doughs fall into one of the following methods. Although some recipes vary, most will be roughly the same and making changes will produce predictable results (e.g., creaming more in the cake method will produce fluffier cake). If you have a ``recipe'' which is only a list of ingredients, just apply the appropriate method.

When fats are involved, different recipes will require fat as a liquid, soft solid, or hard solid. If the fat is an oil or melted, treat it as a liquid. If it is ``softened'' or room-temperature, it is usually worked in to dry flour and allowed to coat the flour to create a tender dough. If it is cold, it will create layers in between bits of flour to create a flaky texture. In this final case, having a metal pan in the freezer can be a way to quickly chill dough if it heats up during working. Some doughs, like pie crust, will have some soft solid and some hard solid to be both tender and flaky.

\subsubsection{The Muffin Method}
The muffin method is often used to prepare muffins and quick-breads.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Combine the dry ingredients. Usually, sifting is suggested. Sifting can be replaced by a trip through a food processor or vigorous whisking.
\item Combine the liquid ingredients and the eggs.
\item Melt the fat and add to the liquid ingredients.
\item Combine the wet and dry ingredients with a minimum of stirring. It \textbf{will} be lumpy and there \textbf{will} be some bits of dry ingredients.
\end{enumerate}

Excessive stirring will cause the over-development of gluten. This would result in a smaller, less tender muffin with tunnels and a peaked crust. 

\subsubsection{The Biscuit Method}
The biscuit method is used to prepare biscuits and dumplings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Combine the dry ingredients.
\item Combine the liquid ingredients and the eggs.
\item Cut the fat into the flour mixture until the mixture has a coarse texture.
\item Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Be careful not to over-mix. Once a ball of dough forms, it can be kneaded briefly.
\end{enumerate}

Cutting the fat into the flour will cause layers to form through the dough. These layers are what makes a biscuit flaky. Again, be aware that over-working the dough will result in biscuits that are less tender and flaky than they should be.
 
\subsubsection{The Cake or Creaming Method}
The cake method is used mainly for cookies and cakes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cream the fat and sugar together.
\item Beat the eggs then add to fat and sugar mixture and beat well.
\item Add the sifted dry ingredients alternately with the liquid ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. After each addition, stir to combine the ingredients then beat briefly.
\item Fold in any flavourings, fruits, and nuts.
\end{enumerate}

Creaming the fat with the sugar and then with the eggs incorporates a lot of air, making the final product fluffy. While over-beating is still a possibility, the fat will help to prevent tough gluten from forming.

\subsubsection{The Bread Method}
The bread method is used for most yeast risen breads, pizza dough, pretzels, and cinnamon buns.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bloom yeast, if using active-dry yeast, using some warm water and sugar. The sugar should only be about \Tp{1} per \C{1} water.
\item Combine the dry ingredients. If using volumetric measurements, reserve some of the flour.
\item Combine the liquid ingredients.
\item Add yeast to liquid ingredients.
\item Stir until stiff.
\item Knead until dough passes the window pane test. The test is performed by gently stretching the dough. If the dough can be stretched thin enough for light to pass through without tearing, the dough is done. If the dough is too sticky, the reserved flour can be added sparingly; a dough which is too moist is usually better than a dough which is too dry. Over-kneading is possible, but nearly impossible by hand and unlikely using a mixer.
\item Let ``ferment'' (first rise), usually, until doubled in bulk. This takes, in most recipes, 1 to 2~hours. Sometimes, this step is done in a refrigerator, in which case it is ``retarded'' and this takes over night.
\item ``Turn'' (deflate or punch-down) the dough by folding the dough like a letter and flattening with finger tips. The purpose is \textbf{not} to remove every gas bubble from the bread.
\item Let ``proof'' (second rise). This rise may also be ``retarded''.
\item Infrequently, the dough maybe turned and proofed again. Each subsequent cycle will take longer than the previous one.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Yeast Types}
For bread baking, most commonly used yeast is \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisi\ae}, commonly called baker's yeast or brewer's yeast. It is capable of digesting many sugars as a food source including the maltose produced by the break down of starch in the flour. The types of yeast below are listed from most potent to least potent. The can all be substituted for one another if the quantity is adjusted. If too much yeast is added, the final product will taste of yeast and too little will rise prohibitively slowly. Yeast grow optimally at \tC{30} and will die if exposed to temperatures greater than \tC{40}.

\begin{description}
\item[Compressed Yeast] -- Yeast is sold in a beige block which is firm to the touch but crumbles when pressed. Also referred to as live yeast, fresh yeast, or a yeast cake. It has a short shelf life of only a month in the fridge and risks growing mould. It can be frozen, ideally in a deep freezer and should not be defrosted repeatedly. It can be crumbled directly into dough or dissolved in water. A ``cube'' is \gr{25}.
\item[Instant Yeast] -- Yeast is sold in granules that have a very long shelf life. The most common brand is Fleischmann's. Also referred to as Rapid-Rise or Quick-Rise. It does not need to be ``activated'' before use, but it should be dissolved in water. Activating it does no harm. It can be stored unopened for 1~year; once opened, 3~months if stored in the fridge or 6~months in the freezer.
\item[Active Dry Yeast] -- Yeast is sold in granules that have a fairly long shelf life. Instant yeast has effectively replaced active dry. One can be substituted for the other, but less instant is required. Yeast must be ``activated'' by mixing with warm sugar water and allowing to stand for 10~minutes. It can be stored unopened for 1~year; once opened, 3~months if stored in the fridge or 6~months in the freezer.
\item[Sourdough Starter] -- Naturally occurring yeast, usually \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisi\ae}, \textit{Saccharomyces exiguus}, and/or \textit{Candida} sp.,  and lactic acid bacteria are present in a piece of dough. Also referred to as a sponge. The starter is ``fed'' and some is used for baking and some is reserved for future use. Starter can be kept in the fridge for months if no mould grows, but is ideally fed at least every other week. If substituting, some of the water and flour in the recipe must be substituted for starter. If more than half of the water comes from the starter, the final bread will be sour.
\end{description}

Conversion can be done as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Instant $\to$ Compressed : $\times 3$
\item Active Dry $\to$ Compressed : $\times 2.5$
\item Instant $\to$ Active Dry : $\times 1.25$
\end{itemize}

Osmotolerant yeast is a type of yeast bred to survive the high osmolarity (i.e., high sugar and salt concentrations) of sweet breads. Other forms of yeast will not raise the bread sufficiently without imparting a yeast flavour due to a need for more yeast to be added. It can be purchased in the US in an instant form.

\section{General Tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water in a stainless steel pot should be salted after boiling as the salt will corrode and pit the metal.
\item Before making a substitution, consult The Cook's Thesaurus~(\url{http://www.foodsubs.com/}).
\item There are two kinds of ice-cream: New York-style and Philadelphia-style. New York-style has a custard (i.e., egg base) and is cooked. Philadelphia-style has no eggs and is usually uncooked. The difference gives New York-style a very rich and heavy flavour while Philadelphia-style is usually more light and fruity.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Pasta Specific Tips:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dishes from the ``Pasta'' category must be served immediately, while dishes in the ``Pasta Sauce'' can be made ahead of time and frozen.
\item When removing meat from pasta sauce, a small well of pasta water should be added to ``rinse'' the meat as it is being removed.
\item When dressing pasta Nonna-style, toss the pasta with half the cheese and half the tomato sauce, put into individual dishes, sprinkle remaining cheese and ladle remaining sauce on top. Adding sauce with cheese on top is ``ristorante''-style.
\item If substituting canned tomatoes, diced tomatoes are equivalent to tomato pieces in most recipes and crushed tomatoes are equivalent to purée.
\item Rice may be substituted for pasta in many dishes by boiling the Arborio rice in a large volume of salted water.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Bread Specific Tips:
\begin{itemize}
\item To raise bread faster, put the bread in a cold oven with a bowl or pot of boiled water. Reheat the water when it cools.
\item To make a firmer crust on breads, increase the oven temperature and steam the oven by cracking the door and wetting the sides of the oven with a spray bottle of water or dropping ice cubes in a pan with rocks.
\item The oven should be preheated \tF{50} above the target temperature to compensate for the heat lost when the oven door is opened to insert the bread.
\item Starter, whisked down, has a density of \gr{300} per \C{1}.
\item According to Alton Brown, bread should be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of \tF{207}. Any higher than \tF{210} and the water inside the bread will boil causing the bread to boil. Lower than \tF{205} will result in under cooked yeasty-flavoured bread. Times are suggestions based on experience before cooking by temperature or for recipes where inserting a temperature probe is not practical. Any recipes where bread is not cooked to \tF{207} are explicitly labelled. If a bread has reached \tF{207} but the crust is not dark enough, decrease oven temperature by \tF{50} and watch that the internal temperature does not exceed \tF{210}. The temperature probe should not be inserted until the crust forms. Allow the bread to bake for 10~minutes before inserting the meat thermometer.
\item Starter should be grown in glass, plastic, or stainless steel vessels.
\item Malt extract syrup and malt extract powder can be interchanged. Malt syrup is 20\% water and the powder has no water. Adjust the water in the recipe appropriately.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Emergency Tips:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the oven is not working, place a cake in a large pot raised off the bottom using a metal rack, trivet, or jar lids. Add water to the pot and steam the cake. Cook for the usual length of time.
\item If you do not have an ice cream maker, you can freeze the ice-cream solid, cut it into cubes, and use a blender to liquefy the cubes, then freeze the mixture. This method will never produce ice crystals as small as a real ice-cream maker, but the final product will be fairly smooth.

\chapter{Microbiology}
Sourdough and cheese recipes require some ``real'' microbiology work. These are derived from laboratory procedures and some laboratory equipment.
\begin{multicols}{2}\raggedcolumns
\section{Aseptic Technique}
Microbiology work requires ``aseptic technique'' which is a work method to prevent contamination so that only a single microorganism will be cultivated. Proper technique is not possible or necessary in the kitchen. In general, the following must be observed:
\section{Glassware}

For yeast, the ideal growing environment is a vented Erlenmeyer flask on a magnetic stirrer. The stirring helps aerate the media as yeast prefer to be oxygenated. If not available, it can be skipped, but the flash should be swirled occasionally. Special vented caps are available to allow air to flow into the flask but prevent dust from contaminating the culture. If not available, cover with a piece of aluminium foil. If an Erlenmeyer flask is not available, use any glass vessel with a narrow neck.

For cheese, the ideal growing environment is a sealed Erlenmeyer flask. If on a magnetic stirrer, soft cheeses like quark\seerecipe{Cheese:Quark} will be smoother. If this is not available, run the final product through a blender to remove any crystalline lumps. If a stoppered flask is not available, any clear sealed glass container will work. Beware of odour transfer between the cheese and the rubber seal of a jar.

\begin{itemize}
