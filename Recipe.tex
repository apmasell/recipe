\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Welcome}

These are recipes I have collected from various places. Most of them are
family recipies. Some recpies are marked \UNTESTED meaning I have not
made them, but they seem sound.  I will test them eventually. Some recipes are marked with \FIXME{}. These are undoubtedly family recipes lacking quantities. If you make one of these, please accurately measure the ingredients and help me update this book.\par

\section{Preparation}

This has been typeset using \LaTeX{}, using custom recipe environments.
The cover graphic was made in Inkscape.\par

\section{Conversion Hints}

It is good to know that: \par

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\tp{3} & = & \Tp{1} & = & \oz{\half} \\
\C{1} & = & \oz{8} & = & \qt{\quarter}
\end{tabular}

\section { Bread Cooking }
According to Alton Brown, bread should be cooked until it reaches an internal termperature of \tF{207}. Any higher than \tF{210} or lower than \tF{205} will result in bad bread. Times are suggestions based on experience before cooking by temperature or for recipes where inserting a temperature probe is not practical. Any recipes where bread is not cooked to \tF{207} are explicitly labelled.
