\begin{enumerate*}
\item Place the rod at an angle to the dough so the right tip of the rope meets the rod a few inches from the right end of the rod.
\item Hold the left end of the rod between the thumb and forefinger.
\item Using the base of the right thumb, roll the dough into the rod applying light pressure at the point of winding. The coils should just touch.
