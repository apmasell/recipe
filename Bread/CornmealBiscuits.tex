\begin{recipe}{Cornbread Drop Biscuits}{Smitten Kitchen}{}

\begin{ingredients}
\item \C{1\threequarter} (\gr{230}) all-purpose flour
\item \C{\twothird} (\gr{90}) cornmeal
\item \Tp{1 to 2} granulated sugar (use 1 for a more savory biscuit)
\item \Tp{1} baking powder
\item \tp{\half} baking powder
\item \tp{\half} fine sea or table salt
\item \C{\half} (\gr{115}) cold butter, in cubes
\item \C{1} (\mL{235}) cold buttermilk
\end{ingredients}

\begin{directions}
\item Preheat oven to \tF{450}. I covered my baking sheet with parchment paper but it shouldn't be strictly necessary, and many shouldn't go in this hot of an oven, so use your own discretion.
\item Stir flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in the bottom of a large bowl with a fork or whisk.
\item Add butter and toss to coat cubes in dry mixture.
\item Use your finger or a pastry blender to break the butter into smaller and smaller bits, until the largest is pea-sized.
\item Add buttermilk and stir once or twice, until a dough comes together.
\item Separate dough into 8 or 12 sections.
\item Form each section into a biscuit on your baking sheet.
\item Bake for 12 to 14 or 15 minutes; smaller ones should be done at 12, larger ones at 14 or 15.
\item Remove from oven and serve warm.
\item Biscuits are best on the first day. On the second, gently rewarming them will improve the texture.
