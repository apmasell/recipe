\begin{recipe}{Hard Candy}{}{6~large suckers}

\begin{ingredients}
\item \C{\third} light corn~syrup
\item \C{1} sugar
\item \C{\half} water
\item \tp{\eighth} flavoured oil or \tp{\quarter} extract
\item 1~drop food colouring~(optional)
\item confectioner's sugar
\end{ingredients}

\begin{directions}
\item If using metal or plastic moulds, rub with vegetable oil. Silicone moulds do not need this step.
\item Combine corn~syrup, sugar, and water in a saucepan.
\item Bring to a boil.
\item Cook until a temperature of \tF{310} has been reached.
\item Add flavoured oil and food colouring and swirl to mix.
\item Pour into moulds.
\item Let cool and harden.
\item Toss in confectioner's sugar to prevent sticking.
\end{directions}

\hint{If you do not have moulds, pour the candy out in a greased tray. As soon as it becomes cool enough to handle, cut it into strips and then squares using shears.}
\hint{The saucepan should have the capacity to hold triple the volume of the ingredients.}
\hint{Do not stir the mixture while cooking. It will weaken the structure of the final candy.}
\end{recipe}
